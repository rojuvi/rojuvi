### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Rodrigo, software developer for convenience, general tinkerer by nature

I like to work on diverse projects to make life easier. I own a 3D printer and I regret nothing.
I'm currently working on some home automation projects based on connecting ESP8266 powered devices to Home Assistant via MQTT.
